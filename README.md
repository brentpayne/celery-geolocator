### Run geocoder celery worker

We only want to use our free daily Google API limit of geocode requests per day.  To help maintain this, we
use a single celery worker that runs a rate limited geocoder.  The celery worker reads all tasks off a queue
populated by python calls to **`gecode.delay(unformatted_address)`**.  running the celery worker.

```sh
$ celery -A celery_geolocator worker --loglevel=info
```
